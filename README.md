# Npontu tasks
This is a simple productivity tool for managing your
tasks and for assigning tasks in team-based environments.

## Testing
Tests can be found at `/tests`

## CI/CD
As a web app, it's hosted at [Npontu-Tasks](https://software.nupsgknust.org)
and uses Github Actions to automate a deployment pipeline.
You can test this by editing the homepage (/resources/views/index.blade.php) and 
pushing to the main branch.
E.g changing the text on line 33 from 'heya' to 'hello'

## Fibonacci
The solution to the Fibonacci class assignment can
be found in the `/fibonacci` folder. Due to the restrictions on the PHP Language 
*(Result of requried computation could not be represented as it exceeded the max number value)*
Hence **Python** was used to tackle the problem instead.

## Docker
Docker file is `/docker-compose.yml`


Thank you.
